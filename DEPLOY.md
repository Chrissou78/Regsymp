# Deploying RegSymp

The site is an [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/) build. `npm run build` writes
static files to `_site/`, and `server.js` serves them and runs the invitation
endpoint in the same process.

## Railpack (our own host)

`railpack.json` pins Node 22 and sets the start command. Railpack detects the
Node provider from `package.json`, installs dependencies, runs the `build`
script, then runs `npm start`.

No further configuration is needed. Note that Eleventy is a **runtime**
dependency rather than a dev dependency on purpose: builders that install with
`NODE_ENV=production` skip `devDependencies`, which would leave the build with
no Eleventy.

The server binds `PORT` (default 3000) and `HOST` (default `0.0.0.0`).

### Environment variables

The invitation form needs all three. Without them the endpoint still validates
input, but returns a 502 telling the visitor to email instead — it never fails
silently.

| Variable | Value |
|---|---|
| `RESEND_API_KEY` | from resend.com |
| `RESEND_FROM` | a verified sender, e.g. `RegSymp <noreply@regsymp.com>` |
| `INVITATION_RECIPIENT` | `info@regsymp.com` |

Resend also needs SPF and DKIM records on `regsymp.com` before it will deliver
reliably. Adding the key without the DNS records is not enough.

## Vercel

`vercel.json` sets the build command, output directory, clean URLs and cache
headers. `api/request-invitation.js` runs as a serverless function.

Both hosts share one implementation: `api/_lib/send-invitation.js` does the
validating and sending, and the Vercel function and `server.js` are thin
wrappers over it. Change the behaviour there, not in two places.

## Local

```bash
npm install
npm run dev     # Eleventy dev server with live reload, port 8091
npm run build   # production build into _site/
npm start       # run the production server against _site/
npm test        # build, then 46 tests
```

## What the tests cover

`npm test` builds first, then asserts against the real output: every page has
nav, footer, canonical and OG tags; exactly one `h1`; every image carries
width and height; JSON-LD parses; no internal link 404s; and **every image
reference resolves with exactly matching case**.

That last one is not theoretical. Four speaker photos and the whole carousel
pointed at paths whose casing differed from the files on disk. Windows and
macOS resolve those happily; Linux does not, so they were 404ing in production
while looking fine locally.

`tests/server.test.js` covers the production server: clean-URL redirects,
cache headers, ETag/304, path-traversal rejection, and the API's validation
and failure modes.
